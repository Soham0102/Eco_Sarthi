# JantaVoice - Voice Complaint System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

This system fixes the issue where voice complaints were not reflecting in the admin dashboard. The main problems were:

1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: Frontend was calling `/api/voice-complaint` but the endpoint didn't exist
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Voice bot was sending Hindi field names but backend expected English
3. **Missing Required Fields**: Complaint endpoint required `urgency` field that was missing
4. **Database Connection Issues**: No error handling when MongoDB was unavailable

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend (in new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test Voice Complaint System
```bash
cd backend
python test_voice_complaint.py
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend (`app.py`)
- ✅ Uncommented and fixed Flask app configuration
- ✅ Added missing `/api/voice-complaint` endpoint
- ✅ Fixed voice bot function calls

### Voice Bot (`enhanced_jantavoice.py`)
- ✅ Fixed data mapping from Hindi to English fields
- ✅ Added missing `urgency` field
- ✅ Ensured all required fields are present
- ✅ Added fallback values for missing data

### Frontend (`VoiceComplaint.jsx`)
- ✅ Added missing `urgency` field to complaint submission
- ✅ Fixed data mapping between voice bot and complaint endpoint

### Database Handling
- ✅ Added error handling for MongoDB connection issues
- ✅ Added fallback responses when database is unavailable
- ✅ Added logging for debugging

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Frontend** calls `/api/voice-complaint`
2. **Backend** generates mock voice complaint data (Hindi fields)
3. **Frontend** maps Hindi fields to English and submits to `/api/complaint`
4. **Backend** saves complaint to database (if available)
5. **Admin Dashboard** fetches complaints from `/api/admin/complaints`

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Voice Complaint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/voice-complaint
```

### Test Complaint Submission
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/complaint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "description": "Test complaint",
    "location": "Test Location",
    "urgency": "normal",
    "department": "General"
  }'
```

### Test Admin Complaints
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/complaints
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Not Running
- System will work in fallback mode
- Complaints won't be saved but endpoints will respond
- Check MongoDB connection: `mongod --version`

### Voice Bot Issues
- Check if required audio libraries are installed
- System includes mock data for testing without audio

### Frontend Issues
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify proxy configuration in `package.json`

## 📝 Required Fields

Complaints must include:
- `name` - Complainant's name
- `description` - Complaint details
- `location` - Location of issue
- `urgency` - Priority level (normal/high/critical)
- `department` - Relevant department

## 🎉 Result

✅ Voice complaints now properly flow from frontend to backend  
✅ Complaints are saved to database (when available)  
✅ Admin dashboard displays all complaints  
✅ System works even without MongoDB (fallback mode)  
✅ Proper error handling and logging throughout
